        <p class="container_rules_paragraph">Red goes first in the first game.
          Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. 
          The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
          The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.</p>
